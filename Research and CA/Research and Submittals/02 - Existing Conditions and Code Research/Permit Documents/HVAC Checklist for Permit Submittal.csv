_GeneralNote:  Wisconsin Code allows for the submission of HVAC plans at a time after the approval of the building plans.  Such submission may involve a different designer, than that of the building plan submission.  In all cases, it is extremely important that the HVAC designer coordinate their plan submission with the building plans.  This checklist will help provide that coordination.  Failure to address the topics below follow may result in delay of the plan approval and possibly additional plan review fees.

HVAC EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENT "1. Equipment ""replacement"": is a removal of existing, and the installation of new heating, ventilating, or air conditioning equipment with no changes to existing ductwork or piping other than as necessary to fit the new equipment to the existing system.  ""Replacement"" does not include changing equipment sizes or capacities to accommodate building alterations or additions.  Substantial changes to ductwork or piping and changes to HVAC equipment sizes or output capacities due to a building addition or alteration will require HVAC alteration plan to be submitted in accordance with section SPS 361.31. "
HVAC EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENT 2. “One-for-one” HVAC/ boiler/ refrigeration equipment replacements do not need to be submitted for review, but must comply with SPS chapters 361-365.  However, for boilers and refrigeration units all owners/designers are required to file Form SBD-6314 with the Division of Industry Services, Field Services Bureau. Those forms may be obtained free of charge by calling 608-266-1818 or download from the Dept. of Safety & Professional Services website at http://dsps.wi.gov/Programs/IndustryServices/Industry-Services-Programs/Boilers-and-Pressure-Vessels/Boilers-and-Pressure-VesselsForms/
HVAC EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENT 3. Although submission to the state is not required, local ordinances may require HVAC equipment information to be submitted prior issuing HVAC permits.  Any fees associated with local HVAC permits would be defined by the municipality issuing the permit. 
HVAC EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENT 4. Replacement of equipment (similar in size or greater): No state fee or submittal required.  Register any boiler/refrigeration replacements with the Division of Industry Services, Field Services Bureau. (as noted above).
